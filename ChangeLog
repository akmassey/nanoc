nanoc Release Notes
===================

2.1
---

New:

* Maruku filter
* Erubis filter
* The `compile` command now takes an optional path, so you can compile
  a single page instead of the entire site if you want
* Better source code documentation
* A new filesystem data source named "filesystem2", which stores pages and
  layouts in single files instead of directories

Changed:

* Layout processors and filters have been merged, so you don't have to write
  the same code twice
* Layouts no longer rely on file extensions to determine the layout processor
  used, and layouts are now stored in directories instead of simple files
* nanoc will no longer compile already compiled pages, unless they have been
  updated in the mean time

Removed:

* The `eruby`, `markdown`, `textile` filters no longer exist; instead, use
  `erb` or `erubis` (for embedded Ruby), `bluecloth` or `maruku` (for
  Markdown) and `redcloth` (for Markdown and Textile)
* The database and trivial data sources are no longer included in the standard
  nanoc distribution, but you can get them from the plugins repository now
