== Overview

nanoc is a simple but very flexible content management system written in Ruby.
It operates on local files, and therefore does not run on the server. nanoc
"compiles" the local source files into HTML (usually), by evaluating eRuby,
Markdown, etc.

== Documentation

nanoc has a web site at <http://nanoc.stoneship.org/>, which contains a
"Getting Started" guide as well as a reference for nanoc.
