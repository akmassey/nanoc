== Overview

nanoc is a simple but very flexible static site generator written in Ruby.
It operates on local files, and therefore does not run on the server. nanoc
"compiles" the local source files into HTML (usually), by evaluating eRuby,
Markdown, etc.

== Documentation

nanoc's web site, which can be found at http://nanoc.stoneship.org, contains a
tutorial and a manual to help you get started with nanoc.

Hackers that simply love poking around in other people's source code should
start by taking a look at the documentation for Nanoc::Site, which pretty much
is the central class in nanoc.
