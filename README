== Overview

nanoc is a simple but very flexible static site generator written in Ruby.
It operates on local files, and therefore does not run on the server. nanoc
"compiles" the local source files into HTML (usually), by evaluating eRuby,
Markdown, etc.

== Documentation

nanoc has a web site at <http://nanoc.stoneship.org/>, which contains a
tutorial and a manual to help you get started with nanoc.
