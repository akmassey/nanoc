What nanoc is and does
----------------------

nanoc is a simple but very flexible content management system written in Ruby. It operates on local files, and therefore does not run on the server.

nanoc can be told to "process" files, meaning it evaluates eRuby, converts Markdown to HTML, cleans up quotation marks, etc. The output can be anything, but will in most cases be static HTML files without embedded Ruby/PHP/whatever code.

Getting started
---------------

First, create a nanoc-powered site, like this:

  % nanoc create_site my_site

This will create a directory named 'my_site' in the current working directory, filled with other directories and files needed by nanoc. For more information about what these directories are about, read the 'Directory Structure' section.

Secondly, `cd` into the newly created directory and create a page, like this:

  % cd my_site
  % nanoc create_page about

This will create a directory 'about' in the 'content' directory of the current working directory. The 'about' directory will contain a metafile as well as a content file.

Lastly, process the output, like this:

  % nanoc process

This will process al pages and put them in their layout.

Directory structure
-------------------

The general directory structure looks like this:

* /
  * config.yaml
  * content/
  * layout/
  * output/
  * templates/

The 'config.yaml' file contains general configuration details. Read the 'Configuration' section for more information.

The 'content' directory contains unprocessed content, such as pages and articles. Every subdirectory of the 'content' directory, as well as 'content' directory itself, contains an index file and a meta file.

The 'layout' directory contains layout files in eRuby format.

The 'output' directory will contain all processed HTML files generated by nanoc. This can be this site's webroot. Note that the output directory path can be changed in the configuration file.

The 'templates' directory contains page templates, used when generating new pages.

Configuration
-------------

The 'config.yaml' file contains general configuration details. Currently, the only configuration option is the output directory ('output_dir'), which can be set to a path to which nanoc will write its output.

To do

nanoc isn't finished, and probably never will be. Here's a list of stuff which hasn't been implemented yet.

* Nested layouts.
