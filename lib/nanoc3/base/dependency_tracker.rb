  # Responsible for remembering dependencies between items. It is used to
  # speed up compilation by only letting an item be recompiled when it is
  # outdated or any of its dependencies (or dependencies’ dependencies, etc)
  # is outdated.
  #
  # The dependencies tracked by the dependency tracker are not dependencies
  # based on an item’s content. When one item uses an attribute of another
  # item, then this is also treated as a dependency. While dependencies based
  # on an item’s content (handled in {Nanoc3::Compiler}) cannot be mutually
  # recursive, the more general dependencies in Nanoc3::DependencyTracker can
  # (e.g. item A can use an attribute of item B and vice versa without
  # problems).
  #
  # The dependency tracker remembers the dependency information between runs.
  # Dependency information is stored in the `tmp/dependencies` file. This file
  # also contains a version number; when a dependencies file with an
  # incompatible version is found, it is ignored.
