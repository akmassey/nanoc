  # Nanoc3::DependencyTracker is responsible for remembering dependencies
  # between items. It is used to speed up compilation by only letting an item
  # be recompiled when it is outdated or any of its dependencies (or
  # dependencies' dependencies, etc) is outdated.
  #
  # The dependencies tracked by the dependency tracker are not dependencies
  # based on an item's content. When one item uses an attribute of another
  # item, then this is also treated as a dependency. While dependencies based
  # on an item's content (handled in Nanoc3::Compiler) cannot be mutually
  # recursive, the more general dependencies in Nanoc3::DependencyTracker can
  # (e.g. item A can use an attribute of item B and vice versa without
  # problems).
