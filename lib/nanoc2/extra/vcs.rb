module Nanoc2::Extra

  # Nanoc2::Extra::VCS is a very simple representation of a version control
  # system that abstracts the add, remove and move operations. It does not
  # commit. This class is primarily used by data sources that store data as
  # flat files on the disk.
  #
  # This is the abstract superclass for all VCSes. Subclasses should implement
  # the indicated methods.
