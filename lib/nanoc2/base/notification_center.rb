module Nanoc2

  # Nanoc2::NotificationCenter provides a way to send notifications between
  # objects. It allows blocks associated with a certain notification name to
  # be registered; these blocks will be called when the notification with the
  # given name is posted.
  #
  # It is a slightly different implementation of the Observer pattern; the
  # table of subscribers is not stored in the observable object itself, but in
  # the notification center.
