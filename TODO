To Do
=====

nanoc-specific
--------------

* Make layouts and page compilation a bit more uniform. A page should have
  'pre_layout_filters' and 'post_layout_filters' or something. Don't rely on
  the layout file extension anymore.

* Put nanoc built-in keywords in a namespace in the meta file.

* Add ability to get the filesystem path of the page. Or maybe add ability to
  get a File object representing the current page?

* Add support for evaluating Ruby in meta files. For example, something like
  'last_updated_at: "<%= Time.now %>"' should work.

Web Site
--------

* Add a wiki.

* Add a better bug/issue tracker.

* Add the nanoc commandline app-replacing rakefile which was recently put on
  RubyForge on the Tips & Tricks page.

* Add tags to the Subversion repository.

* Fix typo on a nanoc page. Unfortunately, I can't remember the typo and I
  don't remember where it is either.
