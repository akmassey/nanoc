* Nested layouts
  * meta file should contain a list of layouts in order
  * fo example, a list of layouts like [ "foo", "bar" ] will render the page,
    then render the result in foo, then render the result in bar
* Cleanup instance variables
  * @pages - for all pages that have been compiled so far
  * @page - the current page
  * @content - the content of the current page or layout
  * all other instance variables are deprecated
* Create a real Nanoc::Page class
  * attributes accessed like "@page.title", "@page.tags", ...
* Embedded Ruby-filtered index files should have access to their meta data
